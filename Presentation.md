# Crafting Brilliant User Experiences with WordPress


## What's "digital experience design"?

## What's UX?

> The interaction of a User Group with a digital affordance or property




## Who ARE these users?

It depends who you ask.


### Your clients, of course!

* purchasers
* decision-makers
* influencers
* researchers, short-listers
* checkbox-tickers

### Anyone else?

* job seekers
* media
* staff
* sales
* admins
* competition?

### Machines?

* search engines / schema
* AT / a11y



## User-Centric Experience Design Methodology

1. List as many user groups as you can
2. List your project success criteria / project objectives
3. Revisit your user groups, maybe add more
4. Rank them (unique numbers only!)
5. Determine your cutoff for Target User Groups
6. Understand your Target User Groups
7. Determine your segmentation strategy
8. Design Brilliant Experiences for those User Groups


### Multiple UX?

Yes!

But how?

### WordPress "Users" vs. non-users

* `is_user_logged_in()` and `current_user_can()`
* `is_admin()`

### Mobile vs. Tablet vs. Desktop use cases

* Responsive Design?
* `is_mobile()`?!
* [Mobble](https://github.com/scottsweb/mobble/blob/master/Mobile_Detect.php)?
* [mobiledetect.net](http://mobiledetect.net/)!

### Locale

* JavaScript geolocation API [navigator.geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation)
* GeoIP [Location Services](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-services)
* Enterprise Detection
* i18n

### User Self-Identification

* IA, baby!
* Profile self-selection
* Wizard, guided help?
* Pain points, calls to action
