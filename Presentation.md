## What's "experience design"?

* Think about the end-to-end experience
* Information Architecture
* Visual Experience
* Content
* Interaction Design
* Devices, Wearables
* Social sphere, extending the experience

## What's UX?

> The experience a User Group has interacting with a digital affordance or property


## Who ARE these users?

It depends who you ask.


### Your clients, of course!

* purchasers
* decision-makers
* influencers
* researchers, short-listers
* checkbox-tickers

### Anyone else?

* job seekers
* media
* staff
* sales
* admins
* competition?

### Machines?

* search engines / schema
* AT / a11y



## User-Centric Experience Design Methodology

1. List as many user groups as you can
2. List your project success criteria / project objectives
3. Revisit your user groups, maybe add more
4. Rank them (unique numbers only!)
5. Determine your cutoff for Target User Groups
6. Understand your Target User Groups
7. Determine your segmentation strategy
8. Design Brilliant Experiences for those User Groups


### Multiple UX?

Yes!

But how do you deliver multiple experiences from the same site?

### WordPress "Users" vs. non-users

* `is_user_logged_in()` and `current_user_can()`
* `is_admin()`

### Mobile vs. Tablet vs. Desktop use cases

* Responsive Design?
* `is_mobile()`?!
* [Mobble](https://github.com/scottsweb/mobble/blob/master/Mobile_Detect.php)?
* [mobiledetect.net](http://mobiledetect.net/)!
* JS & WP_API

### Locale

* JavaScript geolocation API [navigator.geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation)
* GeoIP [Location Services](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-services)
* Enterprise Detection
* i18n

### User Self-Identification

* IA, baby!
* Profile self-selection
* Wizard, guided help?
* Pain points, calls to action




## Understand your user groups

### Empathy Mapping

**Empathy** vs. **Sympathy**: Sympathy is having feelings in response to someone, empathy is having the *same* feelings.
		
> Empathy mapping helps you answer the question: "Our users need a better way to _X_  **because** _Y_ "

### Personas & User Scenarios

> A persona represents a cluster of users who exhibit similar behavioral patterns in their purchasing decisions, use of technology or products, customer service preferences, lifestyle choices, and the like. Behaviors, attitudes, and motivations are common to a "type" regardless of age, gender, education, and other typical demographics. In fact, personas vastly span demographics.

### User stories vs. Functional mapping



## Crafting Brilliant Experiences

### What's a Brilliant User Experience?

> A discrete interaction with a digital property that appears to be designed expressly for the user currently having that experience.

### The Five Dimensions of Web User Interaction
		
* **1D: words** should communicate effectively at appropriate reading level
* **2D: visuals** aesthetic, effective visual language; colours; imagery; iconography
* **3D: interface** intuitive, minimal, natural, recognizable
* **4D: time** sequencing, pacing, animation, repeat visits
* **5D: emotion** comes from empathy, relationship beyond the site

### What are the characteristics of a Usable interface?
		
* **Learnability**: how easily can a new user learn to navigate the interface?
* **Understandability**: how well can a user understand what they are seeing?
* **Memorability**: if a user hasnâ€™t visited the system in a while, how well will they remember the interface?
* **Flexibility**: how many ways can a user interact with the system?
* **Robustness**: how well are we supporting users when they face errors, how many errors do they make, and how quickly can they recover from them?
* **Attractiveness**: how visually appealing is the interface?
* **Accessibility**: how accessible is the interface to all users, regardless of ability, technology, or cultural bias?
